## Introduction

Welcome to our community! To pass the bot check and receive the `Newcomer` role, follow these steps.

## Step 1: Join our server and obtain the `Newcomer` and `Fans` roles

If you haven't joined the server yet, please read the verification post, which describes how to join the server and obtain the `Newcomer` and `Fans` roles.

## Step 2: Go to the channel `★⋅korepi-version-roles⋅★`

Locate the channel `★⋅korepi-version-roles⋅★` and choose either the F or V version role. We recommend selecting the F role.

## Step 3: Download the necessary resources

Once you've done that, you will gain access to the corresponding download channel: `★⋅f-download⋅★` or `★⋅v-download⋅★`.

## Step 4: Ready!

In the channel, you will find a link to the current version and the password for the archive. Good luck!
